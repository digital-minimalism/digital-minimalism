    <h4>Introduction</h4>

    <p> What was the first thing you did after waking up today? What was the last thing before falling asleep the day before? How often have you been interrupted in what you were actually doing and looked at your phone because you felt an urge to check? How often did a notification popped up today and notified you with a little *bing* that something happend and it might requires your attention right now? And how long did were you lost in your phone after picking it up due to that notification? Be honest, before you were finally able to put your phone down, were you still looking at the thing that notified you in the first place or were lost on a Wikipedia article about the population of denmark? </p>

    <p>When you think about the time you spent on your electronical devices, would you say it makes you feel guilty? Gives you a feeling of remorse? Why?</p>

    <p> For about twenty years now, technology changed most of our lifes for the better. Our smartphones gave us the incredible possibility to access all the information in the world through the palm of our hand. It entertains us, plays our favourite games, movies, tv-shows, music, books, podcasts, delivers us the latest news and let us connect to all of our friends wherever we are, whenever we want.</p>

    <ul>
    <li>We are always on.</li>
    <li>Always available.</li>
    <li>Always accessible to and for everyone, everywhere.</li>
    </ul>

    <p> Each situation in our life becomes a fight between what happens around us in our life and the feeling that this glowing screen in our pocket gives us whenever we take it out and sink in. That warm and sensational feeling when we get a new message, when a photo of us gets liked, a new season of our favourite tv-show becomes available, we find that one dress we desperately want and order it right away and whenever we unlock a new level in our favourite game.</p>

    <p> Theres always an Exit from what boring or inconvenient situation we are in at the moment. Always that little friend in our pocket that provides us with what we want, immediately. No waiting, no work required. And it always reminds us with a friendly *pling* that something great might just happened and we just have to check, even though we don't particularly need to at the moment.</p>

    <p> Now think again. How often did you check today? How long did you sink in today? What did that make you feel each time? What does that make you feel now? Each time you used your phone today, you probably felt a subtle feeling. You might not even noticed it, but it can be measured. If you would have been in a MRI scan while you were getting that text from your crush, your brain quite likely would light up significantly in an area that is responsible for positive feelings in our body, the reward system of our brain. Your body then would release dopamine to make you feel good, to reward you, to let you feel that subtle glow when your friends liked that holiday picture of yours. It's great. Unfortunately, it's not always there. Sometimge</p>
